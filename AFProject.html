    <p> This is a continuation of the Distortion Pedal project <a href = "DPProject.html" >(found here)</a> <p>
    
    
    <p> The next interation had a visual schematic change and I also took out the LED and star because it didnt work, which isnt surpising at all because there is not enough current to drive an led within the how the circuit is set up.    </p>

    <p>This interation had no room for the battery within the tin, the xx companonts where poking into the battery which can be a pick safety issue.  I unforetunatly dont have any other pictures to show this because the phone I had broke.   </p>



    
    <p>The next and current interation made room for the battery (which is under the analog fuzz logo), this is where this project got the analog fuzz name because it sounded cool.  
      After some guitar player feedback I added some labels for the in and out because I found out that the standard is the other way in most guitar pedals for pedal board flow.  
      I also made a small foot print error from the firtst ineration that I fixed.  I also had feedback that the ODD AC logo thing was really hard to read.  </p>


    <p>some things I want to fix for the next interation is, affortable and accessable bipass switch, i havent added one becasue its expenseive and I cant use a foot switch so im not sure how else to implement it wehre it would be easy to switch with the foot.  also some people i talked to liked that it was super simple and that it made it unquie. but when i was jamming with it, the guitar player was trying to play some jack white seven nation armry and not being able to switch it on while player for the solo was anyoying so im going to try and add an affortable bipass </p>
